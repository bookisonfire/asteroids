Ideas to extend the project in the future. 


    âœ… Add a "game over" screen
    âœ… Add a scoring system
    âœ… Implement multiple lives and respawning
    âœ… Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
    Add acceleration to the player movement
    âœ… Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
    âœ… Add a background image
    Create different weapon types
    âœ… Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
    âœ… Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
    Add a shield power-up
    Add a life power-up
    âœ… Add a main menu
    âœ… Add a pause menu


Be sure to post your highscores!
And feel free to dm any requests or new ideas
